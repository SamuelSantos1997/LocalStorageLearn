Goal
The goal of this project was to deepen the understanding of JavaScript development, particularly the use of localStorage for data storage. All expected objectives are listed in the features section above.

Notes
Everything was placed in a single HTML file so it can be opened and run on any computer, making corrections easier when needed. It can be improved by running it on a local server and separating the code into dedicated folders for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
